  Best Case Time Complexity - O(No. of points in routes)
  Worst Case Time Complexity - O(No. of points in route * No. of gate segments of eligible tolls)

  This function first finds all the eligible Tolls whose entry segments lie within the Route's bounding box.
  For each two points of the route, it finds all the tolls whose entry segments intersect the two points of the route.
  If it finds some entry segments of tolls intersecting the route points, then it goes further on the route to find the exit segment intersecting the toll.
  Once the exit segment is found, it add's the toll and slices the route further to check for anymore tolls if exists till it reaches the end of the route.

  Note:
  In case of on ride it is possible that the batch of driver waypoints that we have has only the start of the toll and the end of the toll comes later.
  In that case this function maintains the TollCombinationsWithStartGatesInPrevBatch based on driverId to check for it's corresponding exit segment intersection on route coming in later batches.
  Once the exit segment is found, it deletes the TollCombinationsWithStartGatesInPrevBatch & add's the toll and slices the route further to check for anymore tolls if exists till it reaches the end of the route.
